    <h1>The Prevalance of Mental Heal Disorders</h1>

    <h3>Anual Percentage of People with Mental Health Disorders by Country</h3>
    <p>To better understand the percents of populations with specific mental health disorders, the following chart was
      created. It compares the percentage of the population of various countries with various mental health disorders
      for the years 1990 - 2017. This chart can be used to examine both how the percentage of populations with mental
      health disorders varies by country and also how the percentages vary with time. This chart shows that for each
      mental health disorder examined, the percent of the population with each disorder is fairly similar across
      countries. On the other hand, there is no clear trend across countries in annual change in the percent of the
      population with each mental health disorder. The most prominent conclusion from this chart is that mental health
      disorders are impacting populations globablly and in many countries, the percentage of the population with various
      mental health disorders is increasing. The high global rates of anxiety and depression disorders are cause for
      concern and require the recognition of the need for change to improve global mental health.</p>

    <h3> A Crowd of 200 and the Number of Those Individuals with Mental Health Disorders in the United States
    </h3>
    <p>To further contextualize the significance of the percentage of populations with specific mental health disorders,
      the following visualization was created. It uses the data for the percentage of the population of the United
      States of America with each mental health disorder in the year 2017. Using a population size of 200, the
      visualization demonstrates how many of these 200 people suffered from each mental health disorder. While
      percentages of the population less than 6% may seem inconsequential, the following visualization shows that these
      percentages are far more significant than they may initially seem. It simulates how many people going about their
      daily lives might be struggling with a mental health disorder. This reinforces the need to address the mental
      health crisis in the United States and globally.</p>
